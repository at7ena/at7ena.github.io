  <h1>Privacy Policy – Grivex</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 3, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>AT7ENA GAMES STUDIO</strong> built the <strong>Grivex</strong> app as a free game with optional in‑app purchases. This page is used to inform users regarding our policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of information, as required by Google Play.</p>

  <h2>1. Information Collection and Use (Third‑Party Services)</h2>
  <p>Grivex does not collect personally identifiable information such as your name, address, phone number, or email.</p>
  <p>However, the app uses third‑party services, such as Unity Ads, which may collect anonymous data for advertising and performance analysis purposes. This data may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device identifiers (Advertising ID);</li>
    <li>Type and version of the operating system;</li>
    <li>Anonymous usage data (e.g., playtime or ad interactions).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The collection and use of such information follow the privacy policies of the services involved.</p>
  <p>👉 <a href="https://unity.com/legal/game-player-and-app-user-privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unity Privacy Policy</a></p>

  <h2>2. Local Data Storage (PlayerPrefs)</h2>
  <p>The app stores gameplay progress and settings <strong>locally on your device</strong> using Unity’s standard storage tools (<em>PlayerPrefs</em>). These data are required for the game’s functionality and include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The player’s best score;</li>
    <li>The currently selected skin (visual theme).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This information is <strong>not transmitted</strong> to our servers and remains stored <strong>only on your device</strong>.</p>

  <h2>3. In‑App Purchases</h2>
  <p>The game offers <strong>optional in‑app purchases</strong> (such as skins and cosmetic items). All transactions are securely processed by the <strong>Google Play Store</strong>, and <strong>AT7ENA GAMES STUDIO</strong> does <strong>not</strong> access or store any payment information.</p>

  <h2>4. Internet Connectivity</h2>
  <p><strong>Grivex</strong> can be played offline, but certain features — such as ad loading — require an internet connection. Without internet access, the game remains playable, but <strong>ads will not be displayed</strong>.</p>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>We value your trust in providing us with non‑personal information and strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect it. However, please remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>6. Links to Third‑Party Services</h2>
  <p>The game may display content or links from external services (such as ads). <strong>AT7ENA GAMES STUDIO</strong> is not responsible for the privacy practices of these third‑party services and recommends reviewing their respective privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>This game does <strong>not knowingly collect data from children under the age of 13</strong>. If any such data is discovered, it will be deleted immediately.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.</p>
